The program's purpose is to maxsimize the profit for the hotel by getting as much guests as possible into an hotel room.
It does so by constantly going over the guests and rooms list and matching guest to a room' according to the guest's budget.
The program uses inter thread communication and mutexs in order to manage the hotel properly such that only one guest can 
stay in each room at once.
